> [!NOTE]
> This plugin is under heavy development, most of the implemented features are NOT meant to work.

## Features
* Friends system (under development)
* Party system (works, needs further attention and work)
* Guild system (under heavy development)
* MySQL support for Friends and Guilds, while Parties are saved locally.

## TODO
- [ ] Finish the basic infrastructure of all the systems.
- [ ] Add JSON support for Parties.
- [ ] Interaction through Forms and not through commands. (Maybe add custom-made forms?)
- [ ] Ability to customize any message sent to players.
- [ ] Ranking system (includes Ranks-Titles, statistics, rewards etc).
- [ ] Add social settings in-game (turning on/off requests, player visibility etc)
- [ ] Implement ability to customize the amount of ranks, their names and permissions they have for the Party and Guild system.

Suggestions are always welcome!!
