# Society
Society is a Pocketmine plugin built to deliver servers a working... society; making friends, creating parties and guilds hasn't been easier!

# Features
* Friends system (under development)
* Party system (works, needs further attention and work)
* Guild system (under heavy development)
* MySQL support for Friends and Guilds, while Parties are saved locally.

# Contributions/Collaborations
NOTE: This plugin is under heavy development - most of the "supposed" features are NOT meant to work.\
Contributions are always welcome. Please open an Issue for any bug you come across.
For collaborations, please contact me in my discord: "immooo."
## TODO
- [ ] Finish the basic infrastructure of all the systems.
- [ ] Add JSON support for Parties.
- [ ] Interaction through Forms and not through commands. (Maybe add custom-made forms?)

Suggestions are always welcome!!
